---

This section covers the fundamentals of ROS 2, the robotic nervous system, focusing on its architecture and core concepts essential for controlling humanoid robots.

## Topics
*   ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
*   Nodes, topics, services, and actions
*   Building ROS 2 packages with Python
*   Launch files and parameter management

## Hands-On
- Create a multi-node demo: sensor ingest → simple filter → actuator command.
- Author a URDF for a bipedal skeleton; visualize and test joint limits.
- Add launch files to orchestrate bring-up; tune QoS for stable message delivery.

## Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Nodes publish/subscribe at target rates without dropped messages.
- [ ] URDF renders correctly and passes collision checks.
- [ ] Launch files bring up the stack reliably with parameter overrides.
