This section introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, exploring the transition from digital AI to robots that interact with the physical world. It also covers the landscape of humanoid robotics and essential sensor systems.

## Topics
*   Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
*   From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws
*   Overview of humanoid robotics landscape
*   Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors

## Hands-On
- Install ROS 2 on Ubuntu 22.04; verify nodes, topics, and services with `ros2` CLI.
- Create a starter ROS 2 Python package; publish/subscribe to a simple sensor topic.
- Inspect URDF samples for humanoid joints; visualize in RViz.

## Readiness Checklist
- [ ] ROS 2 workspace builds without errors.
- [ ] Basic pub/sub demo runs with expected message rates.
- [ ] Team can explain how sensor data flows into perception and control loops.
